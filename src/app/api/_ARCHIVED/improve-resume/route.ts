- If a section is empty in the original resume, leave it empty or use an empty array
- Focus on making existing content more impactful and professional

- Ensure all content is 100% factual and based on provided data
- The goal is to present existing information in a more compelling way, not to add new information
- For the professional summary, focus on their actual experience and achievements, not generic statements
- Double-check that you haven't accidentally left out any work experience, skills, education, or other sections from the original data`;
